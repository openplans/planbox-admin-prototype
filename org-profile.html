The sidewalks on Lexington Avenue between E.42nd and E.45th Streets are overcrowded often leading to pedestrians walking in the street creating an unsafe condition for all users. DOT has proposed installing two painted neckdowns to shorten the crossing distances at E.43rd and E.44th Streets while providing additional pedestrian space, adding a new right-turn only lane on Lexington at E.42nd Street and reconfiguring the bus only lane between E.42nd and E.44th Streets to enhance mobility.<br><a href=# class="label radius">bus</a> <a href=# class="label radius">pedestrian</a></p></div><div class=panel><h4><strong>Ongoing</strong> <a href=#>West End Avenue Traffic Calming and Pedestrian Safety Improvements</a></h4><h6>Safety improvements for W 72nd St to W 106th St on West End Avenue</h6><p>DOT is proposing safety improvements for W 72nd St to W 106th St on West End Avenue.

This critical stretch of roadway is receiving upgraded water and sewer lines, and a resetting of its historic cobblestones. In addition, the plazas along it are being reconstructed and designed by a world-class team of architects and landscape architects as permanent amenities. The geometric design, which is influenced by both historic and pragmatic considerations, and has implications for traffic movement throughout the adjacent neighborhoods, was presented for feedback to the Transportation Committee of Community Board 2 on Tuesday September 11, 2012.<br><a href=# class="label radius">pedestrian</a> <a href=# class="label radius">traffic</a></p></div><div class=panel><h4><a href=#>Borinquen Place Traffic Calming</a></h4><h6>significant pedestrian safety measures to Borinquen between Hooper Street and Marcy Avenue</h6><p>In response to community requests as well as recent pedestrian fatalities along the Borinquen Place corridor in Willismsburg Brooklyn, DOT is proposing significant pedestrian safety measures to the roadway between Hooper Street and Marcy Avenue. Traffic calming measures, much needed pedestrian space, and landscaping are also included in the plan.
